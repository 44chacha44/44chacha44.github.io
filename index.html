		<h1>My Learning Style</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Auditory: 45%</li>
			<li>Visual: 35%</li>
			<li>Tactile: 20%</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Quantitative Accomplishments:</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Hired, trained and mentored 6 employees that helped increase productivity by 20% for resort night staff.</li>
			<li>Added 4 new lines of service per month for 12 months for a mobile carrier.</li>
			<li>Designed and sewed 8 skirts for a flamenco dance group.</li>
		</ul>

		<h1>Qualitative Accomplishments:</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>Attention to details has helped me receive a promotion at a cleaning position. After learning all the expectations, I was thorough in not only cleaning tasks, but logging the tasks and creating plans to finish larger job. This quality proved to also be a weakness because the staff felt like I was asking too much of them.</li>
			<li>Leadership was the skill my boss seen in me that helped him decide to promote me. The project lists and timelines I created and shared with the team and received their buy in was my leadership in action. This skill was a weakness in a conversation with my boss. He was proposing a schedule that I did not agree with for the team. I took it upon my self to speak for them as their "leader" without actually presenting them with the schedule and receiving feedback.</li>
			<li>Adaptablity helped me adhere to the new schedule. I was able to adjust my timelines for daily duties and for the long term projects. This became a weakness because I was adapting more than myself or my crew could handle.</li>

			<h1>Bridging the Gap</h1>
			<img src="current.jpg" alt="current career">
			<img src="future.jpg" alt="future career">
			<p>I chose the first picture to represent my current career status because it represents openness with a variety of options. I have a route in front of me but I can
			veer left, right, up, underwater...what ever I choose. I have to move forward and right now coding is my path in front of me. I can choose to veer left into back end
			development, right to front end, etc.. The second picture to represent my future career is more structured, more laid out, easier to navigate. Almost like a fractal,
			following an set of rules, but still chaotic. I am going to bridge the two by continuing my learning and honing in on what makes my talent shine so that I can have stuctured chaos.</p>

		<h1>Weekly Reflections</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>1/14/19-1/18/19: This week we started learning SQL. I am still not sure about github pages. We had a field trip to Tech Update. I learned about the New Mexico Tech Council, TechHire and Aviata. I met Harrison Fortier.</li>
			<li>1/21/19-1/25/19: So being sick has really hindered my progress. I'm playing catch up and I am back in the groove to learn. Object oriented lingo is a struggle but the more I do it, the more it makes sense. Went to the app competition at UNM and met the schools CIO.</li>
			<li>1/28/19-2/1/19: This week I felt like I accomplished a lot. I'm getting projects completed, I am not 100% confident in describing what I have completed but I am still proud! The guest speakers on Friday were so inspiring.
			There is so much that we can use our skills for and I feel grateful I have this opportunity to learn.</li>
			<li>2/4/19-2/8/19: This week I gained more confidence in my learning abilities. It's a great feeling when pieces of the puzzle start coming together. This weeks speakers inspired me to contemplate more on my brand. I'll begin
			research and get ideas of how to execute on reaching my goals.</li>
